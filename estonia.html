            <h3>Key Tax Advantage: 0% on Retained Profits</h3>
            <p><strong>Estonia's unique system:</strong> Companies pay 0% corporate income tax on profits they keep in the business. The 24% corporate tax only kicks in when you distribute profits as dividends. This encourages reinvestment and growth.</p>

            <p><strong>VAT Threshold:</strong> If your annual taxable turnover is below €40,000, VAT registration in Estonia is not obligatory.</p>

            <h3>Special IT Incentives</h3>
            <p>While there's no specific "IT company" tax rate, all companies benefit from the same 0% retained profits system. Estonia's digital infrastructure and e-services make it particularly attractive for tech companies.</p>

            <h3>Duration of Benefits</h3>
            <p>Permanent, as long as you maintain your Estonian company and comply with regulations. The defense tax is temporary (2026-2028).</p>

        <section class="country-section">
            <h2>Operating Requirements</h2>

            <h3>Minimum Capital Requirements</h3>
            <p><strong>€0.01</strong> - Since 2023 reforms, the minimum share capital is essentially zero.</p>

            <h3>Annual Reporting Obligations</h3>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>Annual report submission (deadline: 6 months after financial year end)</li>
                <li>Monthly tax declarations (even if zero activity)</li>
                <li>Keep accounting records up to date</li>
                <li>Maintain contact person in Estonia</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accounting Requirements</h3>
            <p>All companies must maintain proper accounting records. Most e-residents hire Estonian accounting services (€50-200/month). All filings are done digitally via the e-MTA portal.</p>

            <h3>Local Presence Requirements</h3>
            <p><strong>Contact Person Required:</strong> Estonian law requires a contact person with a registered address in Estonia. This service costs €200-400/year. You do NOT need to live in Estonia or hire local employees.</p>

            <h3>Employee Requirements</h3>
            <p><strong>None</strong> - No requirement to hire Estonian employees. You can operate solo or hire remotely from anywhere.</p>

            <h2>Banking & Financial Services</h2>

            <h3>Bank Account Opening</h3>
            <p><strong>Difficulty: Medium to Hard</strong></p>
            <p>Banking is one of the biggest challenges for e-residents in 2026. Traditional Estonian banks have strict KYC requirements and may be hesitant to open accounts for remote businesses.</p>

            <h3>Available Banking Options</h3>

            <h4>Estonian Banks</h4>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li><strong>LHV Bank</strong> - Most e-resident-friendly, but requires thorough documentation</li>
                <li>Swedbank, SEB - Typically reject e-resident applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs)</h4>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li><strong>Wise</strong> - Popular among e-residents, multi-currency accounts</li>
                <li><strong>Payoneer</strong> - Good for international transactions</li>
                <li>Note: EMIs are not full banks (deposit insurance differs)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
            <p>Full access to international payment processors: Stripe, PayPal, Revolut Business, and other European fintech services.</p>

            <h3>Currency Considerations</h3>
            <p>Estonia uses the Euro (EUR). Multi-currency business accounts available through Wise and other EMIs.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Practical Considerations -->
        <section class="country-section">
            <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Physical Presence</h3>
            <p><strong>Required once:</strong> Only to collect your e-residency card at an embassy or pickup point. After that, zero physical presence required.</p>

            <h3>Remote Management Capabilities</h3>
            <p><strong>Excellent</strong> - Estonia is built for digital. All government services (e-services), banking, contracts, and filings can be done online with your digital signature.</p>

            <h3>Language Barriers</h3>
            <p><strong>Low</strong> - All e-services and government portals are available in English. Most service providers (accountants, lawyers) speak English fluently.</p>

            <h3>Support Services Available</h3>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>Official e-Residency support team</li>
