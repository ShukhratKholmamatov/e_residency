            <h2>Can You Open & Manage Your Business Fully Online?</h2>

            <div class="remote-badge warning">⚠️ PARTIALLY - Physical Visit Required for Setup</div>

            <h3>Setting Up Your Company</h3>
            <p><strong>Physical presence required</strong> for initial company registration, bank account opening, and IT Park residency application. However, IT Park specialists can assist with the entire process.</p>

            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Registration itself takes 1-2 days once you're in Uzbekistan with all documents prepared.</p>

            <h3>What Requires Physical Presence?</h3>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>Company registration (LLC formation) - can be done with documents, but visit recommended</li>
                <li>Opening a business bank account - in-person visit required</li>
                <li>IT Park residency application - visit to IT Park office</li>
                <li>Signing official documents with notarization</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Can Foreign Founders Do It?</h3>
            <p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Only entities registered in Uzbekistan can become IT Park residents. Foreign companies must first register a local LLC. IT Park specialists assist applicants with registration, bank account opening, and tax authority registration - <strong>no physical presence of the applicant is required with proper power of attorney</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Managing Your Business Remotely</h3>
            <p><strong>Yes - Full remote management possible after setup.</strong> Once your company is established as an IT Park resident, you can manage operations remotely.</p>

            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>No requirement to physically be in Uzbekistan after registration</li>
                <li>Remote accounting and reporting possible</li>
                <li>Digital banking available</li>
                <li>IT Park provides ongoing support remotely</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h4>💡 Practical Approach</h4>
                <p>Many founders make one trip to Uzbekistan to handle registration, bank account, and IT Park application all at once (typically 3-5 days), then manage remotely thereafter. Alternatively, use power of attorney with IT Park assistance.</p>

                <li>Maintain IT Park residency requirements</li>
            </ul>
